\subsection{ImageNet} \label{sec:ImageNet}
The general purpose model used for transfer learning, is trained on the \texttt{ImageNet}\autocite{imagenet_cvpr09} dataset, consistent of more than 14 million hand annotated images belonging to more than 20.000 categories. For the purpose of this project, a subset of the dataset with 1.000 classes has been chosen.

As the pictures show in the above figure, this general purpose model is well trained to detect various different objects.
