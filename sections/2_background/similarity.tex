\subsection{Measurement of the Similarity}\label{sec:Similarity}
With respect to the \hyperref[sec:Problem Definition]{Problem Definition} the purpose is to find similarities in rooms. An accuracy measurement is created to calculate the similarity between rooms. For the purpose of this report it is referred to as the top-1 accuracy. The classification accuracy is not considered, because the dataset only has 6 different classes, and is achieving above 95\% accuracy with all investigated model setups. The top-1 accuracy is calculated by creating a similarity matrix between all feature spaces retrieved from the CNN, for each of the data points/images accuracy is then evaluated to true/1 if the closest image is of the same class and false/0 if not. The top-1 accuracy is the mean of the calculated 1-D vector calculated from the similarity matrix.

\subsection{Background Takeaways}\label{sec:Background Takeaways}
The key takeaways from this section, is that through transfer learning it will be possible to for a general-domain CNN to adapt in-domain like feature representations through limited in-domain data. It is also acknowledged that the authors of \textbf{\textit{Khosla}}\autocite{khosla2020supervised}, proved to achieve state of the art top-1 accuracies for the ResNet50 model by supervised contrastive learning, when tested on the ImageNet dataset.
