Trainable layer       & SGD                       \\
Stage 5, block B and C                         & 35.1\%                    \\ \cline{2-2}
\multicolumn{1}{l|}{Stage 5, block A, B and C} & \multicolumn{1}{l|}{36\%} \\ \cline{2-2}
Stage 5 and block C of stage 4                 & 32\%
\end{tabular}

These tests, were created before noticing the problem with the preprocessing function, introduced in \textbf{\textit{Ingwersen}}\autocite{Ingwersen}.
